A .NET Library which captures RgbColor and DepthColor Images from the Azure Kinect Sensor and returns them as Bitmaps.

## Getting Started

To get started add the Package to your Project with NuGet (See Installing instructions).

### Prerequisites

The project lib is currently writte in .NET 4.8 (Full Framework) during some limitations in the System.Drawing Lib of .NET Core.
In order to work with the Lib you need to the Full Framework instead of .NET Core for now.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
